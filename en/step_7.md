## Step 4: Time Trial

Let's add a timer to your game, so that the player has to get to the desert island as fast as possible.

### Activity Checklist

+ Add a new variable called `time` {.blockdata} to your stage. You can also change the display of your new variable. If you need help, have a look at the 'Ghostbusters' project.

+ Now add code to your __stage__, so that the timer counts up until the boat reaches the desert island.

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
On the __stage__, __when the green flag is clicked__, __set the time to 0__ and then __forever__ you'll need to __wait 0.1 secs__ then __change the time by 0.1__. 
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
Here are the code blocks you'll need:

{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's how your code should look:

{: .hint-content .hint-3 }

+ That's it! Test out your game and see how quickly you can get to the desert island!
