## Controlando el bote

\--- task \---

Vas a controlar el bote con tu mouse. Agrega el c√≥digo a tu bote para que comience en la esquina inferior izquierda, apuntado hacia arriba y que luego siga el puntero del mouse. **Test your code** to make sure that it does what it's supposed to do.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- Once the `green flag is clicked`, you'll need to make your boat `go to the start position` and `point up`. Next it will need to `point towards the mouse pointer` and `move 1 step`. It will need to repeat this `forever`.

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you'll need: ![screenshot](images/boat-move-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- This is what your code should look like: ![screenshot](images/boat-move-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

\--- task \---

Test out your boat by clicking the flag and moving the mouse. Does the boat sail towards the mouse?

**Note:** There is currently a bug in Scratch which means your boat may not move towards the mouse pointer. If this happens, click the arrow on the `point towards` block and re-select `mouse-pointer`.

What happens if the boat reaches the mouse pointer? Try it.

To stop this from happening, you'll need to add an `if` block to your code, so that the boat only moves if it is more than 5 pixels away from the mouse.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- The boat should only point towards the mouse pointer and move `if` the `distance to the mouse pointer` is `greater than 5 pixels`. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you'll need to add to the code for the boat: ![screenshot](images/boat-pointer-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- This is what your code should look like: ![screenshot](images/boat-pointer-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

Test out your boat again to check whether the problem has been fixed.
