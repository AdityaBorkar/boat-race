## Challenge: improving your game

- Can you add more obstacles to your game? You could add green slime to your backdrop and make changes to the game so that the slime slows the boat down when the player lets them touch.

- You could add a moving object like a log or a shark!

- Can you turn your game into a race between 2 players? The second player will need to control their boat using the up arrow to move forward and the left and right arrow keys to turn.


- Can you create more backdrops and allow the player to choose between levels?
