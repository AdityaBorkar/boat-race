## Challenge: Winning! {.challenge}
Can you add another `if` {.blockcontrol} statement to your boat's code, so that the player wins when they get to the desert island?

When the boat gets to the yellow desert island, it should say 'YEAH!' and then the game should stop. 

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
You need to more add code _inside_ your __forever__ loop so that your code keeps checking if the player has won. __if__ the boat is __touching__ the colour of the treasure island then you need to __say YEAH! for 2 seconds__ and then __stop all__ to end the game. 
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
Here are the code blocks you'll need:

{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's how your code should look:

Don't forget that it needs to be inside your `forever` {.blockcontrol} loop. 
{: .hint-content .hint-3 }
