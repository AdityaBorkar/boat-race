## 충돌!

지금은 배가 나무 장벽을 통과하여 움직일 수 있습니다. 이 부분을 고쳐봅시다.

You'll need two costumes for your boat, one normal costume, and one for when the boat crashes. Duplicate your boat costume, and name one costume 'normal' and the other 'hit'.

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

Click on your 'hit' costume, and choose the Select tool to grab bits of the boat and move and rotate them around to make it look as if it's crashed.

Now add code to your boat so that it crashes and breaks up when it touches any brown wooden bits.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- You need to add code inside your `forever` loop so that your code keeps checking if the boat has crashed. `If` the boat is `touching` the brown colour of the wood, you need to `switch to the hit costume`, `say Noooo! for 2 seconds`, and then `switch back to the normal costume`. Finally, you'll need to `point up` and `go to the start position`. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you'll need: ![screenshot](images/boat-hit-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's what your code should look like: ![screenshot](images/boat-hit-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

You should also make sure that your boat always starts out looking 'normal'.

If you try to sail through a wooden barrier now, you should see that your boat crashes and moves back to the start.
